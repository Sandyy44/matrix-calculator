# Matrix Calculator
This repository contains a Matrix Calculator program implemented in Python, capable of performing various operations on matrices including summation, subtraction, multiplication (both 2x2 and 3x3), division, transpose, determinant calculation, and inverse calculation (for both 2x2 and 3x3 matrices), as well as scalar division.

## Features
* **Summation:** Adds two matrices together.
* **Subtraction:** Subtracts one matrix from another.
* **Multiplication:** Multiplies two matrices, supporting both 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.
* **Division:** Divides one matrix by another, including scalar division.
* **Transpose:** Finds the transpose of a given matrix.
* **Determinant:** Calculates the determinant of a given matrix.
* **Inverse:** Calculates the inverse of a given matrix, supporting both 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.
* **Scalar Division:** Divides a matrix by a scalar value.

## Examples
Here are some examples of valid inputs for different operations:<br />

* **Summation:** Provide two matrices of the same size.
* **Subtraction:** Provide two matrices of the same size.
* **Multiplication:** Provide two matrices where the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix.
* **Division:** Provide two matrices where the divisor is non-singular.
* **Transpose:** Provide a matrix.
* **Determinant:** Provide a square matrix.
* **Inverse:** Provide a non-singular square matrix.
* **Scalar Division:** Provide a matrix and a scalar value.
